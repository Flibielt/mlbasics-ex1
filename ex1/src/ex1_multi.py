    Exercise 1: Linear regression with multiple variables

    Instructions
    ------------

    This file contains code that helps you get started on the
    linear regression exercise.

    You will need to complete the following functions in this
    exercises:

        warm_up_exercise.py
        plot_data.py
        gradient_descent.py
        compute_cost.py
        gradient_descent_multi.py
        compute_cost_multi.py
        feature_normalize.py
        normal_eqn.py

    For this part of the exercise, you will need to change some
    parts of the code below for various experiments (e.g., changing
    learning rates).
